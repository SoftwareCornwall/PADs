# PADs across Cornwall

This repo contains the back-end stuff.

Dependencies:  
* MySQL  
* Slim  
* Twig-view  


To create the database, run db_create.php.

To create the tables in the database, run tables_create.php.

To create dummy data, run tables_fill.php

To delete all the dummy data in the database, run tables_destroy.php



Ensure that you update the username and password variables in both db_create and db_connect to match the username and password chosen for your database. We simply used "root" and "password".

To set up the Apache stuff, I strongly advise you cheat and use XAMPP. Otherwise, you set up apache at your own risk.

To set everything up, follow these commands:


sudo apt-get install php5-common libapache2-mod-php5 php5 cli

sudo apt-get install apache2

sudo apt-get install mysql-server

sudo a2enmod rewrite


Install slim

sudo composer require slim/slim

Install composer and twig in working dir


Password is empty, unless you set one in install.

mysql -u root -p

mysql>CREATE DATABASE <my_db_name>;

//dev config: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
